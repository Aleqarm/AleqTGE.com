        <p id="P">The Galactic Empire, also known as the First Galactic Empire, Palpatine's New Order, the Imperium or simply the Empire and later the Old Empire, was the galactic government established by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to replace the Galactic Republic in 19 BBY and bring Sith rule to the galaxy.

        The Republic, which had lasted for at least 25,034 years, ended following a period of intense political turmoil and the subsequent devastation of the Clone Wars. After the death of Count Dooku above Coruscant, the death of General Grievous on Utapau and finally the massacre of the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Mustafar, Chancellor Palpatine (by then ruling with near-absolute power) began a purge of the Jedi Order, and then proclaimed himself Emperor of the galaxy and reorganized the Galactic Republic into "the first Galactic Empire" on the galactic capital, Coruscant.

        The Galactic Empire existed as a separate entity in one form or another for 157 years, until in 138 ABY, when it was absorbed by a new organization.</p>

        <text id="Inform">The Empire can be said to have begun with the scheming aspiration of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, known as his alter ego Senator Palpatine of Naboo. He was inspired by the Resurrected Sith Empire, which dominated the galaxy over three millennia earlier. In 32 BBY, he began manipulating pivotal events, such as instigating the Naboo crisis, in which he used the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray as a pawn, to lead Queen Amidala into calling for a "Vote of No Confidence" in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, effectively replacing him and eventually winning the Battle of Naboo with assistance from the Gungans. When his first apprentice, Darth Maul, was defeated by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Sidious took on the former Jedi Count Dooku as his new apprentice. In 24 BBY, Dooku then helped found the Confederacy of Independent Systems with the formation of the Separatist Council, led again by Nute Gunray, on Raxus Prime, igniting the Separatist Crisis. Palpatine, at the end of his second term, was allowed to stay in power until the crisis was resolved. This eventually led to the Clone Wars, which started with the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY.

        At the beginning of the Clone Wars, Palpatine was an efficient and effective leader who quickly brought to an end the corruption in the Senate; his authority was greatly increased even more so than at the start of the Separatist Crisis, via Acting Senator Jar Jar Binks, while the Senate willingly furnished as they gave more and more emergency powers to him. Eventually, the Senate lost most of its power and became little more than a formality that Palpatine had to go through to pass his laws. Yet the Senate retained some symbolic power; Chancellor Palpatine still hid behind the pomp and circumstance of appealing to the Senate, but his power existed in his control over thousands of Senators that he had brought into his own web of corruption.
        However, after the death of Count Dooku onboard the Invisible Hand above Coruscant and the death of General Grievous on Utapau, Anakin Skywalker discovered that Palpatine was a Sith Lord, and after informing Jedi Master Mace Windu of his discovery, a Jedi task force led by Windu himself attempted to arrest him. After a brief duel, Palpatine appeared to be defeated. Skywalker arrived and demanded the Sith Lord's life be spared, that he might stand trial. Deeply troubled, Skywalker nonetheless helped Palpatine kill Windu, prompting him to be held under Palpatine's sway as his new apprentice and enforcer, Darth Vader. Palpatine then proceeded to carry out the Great Jedi Purge, including the massacre of the Jedi Temple itself, which eliminated almost all of the Jedi, while simultaneously wiping out the leaders of the Confederacy on Mustafar, including the Separatist Council representative Nute Gunray, who was Anakin's last victim. The Separatists were reduced to a shadow of their former selves, thus bringing an end to the Clone Wars. Secure in his power and position, Palpatine used the so-called Jedi rebellion to issue the Declaration of a New Order and declared himself Emperor of the galaxy in 19 BBY, replacing the Galactic Republic with the Galactic Empire. Likewise, Palpatine vowed that the newly-formed Empire would reign with ten thousand years of peace.

        Many people under the new Empire enthusiastically supported the vision outlined in the Declaration of a New Order, largely due to the violence that had plagued the galaxy for so long. Many Senators wholeheartedly supported the new government while a number of more cautious senators chose to watch and wait to see how the new government would handle the affairs of state. It promised to trade frailty for strength, chaos for order, and uncertainty for decisiveness. In retrospect, the foundation of the Empire had already been set down during Palpatine's chancellorship and all potential threats eliminated; therefore, the transition from Republic to Empire was relatively smooth.

        It is important to note that not all of the Senators liked what they saw. Shortly before the start of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the Loyalist Committee was formed by more democratic senators. By the eve of the empire, near the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, the Loyalist Committee was reorganised into the Petition of 2000, who sought to bring the worries of these Senators to Palpatine. This petition was led by Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Padmé Amidala. Palpatine's dismissal of their concerns was one factor that led Organa and Mothma to help found the Alliance to Restore the Republic.</text>

        <text id="El">The First Order, or simply the Order, was a fascist military junta in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy during the era of the New Republic. The First Order was ruled by a Supreme Leader from their mobile headquarters instead of a traditional planetary capital. A militaristic dictatorship, the First Order sought to remove disorder from existence and had a fanatical devotion to the totalitarian notions of order and a violent disdain for democracy, and enforcing heavily brutal suppression of dissent and unpatriotic activities. To this end, it became locked in a Cold War with the New Republic and spreading influence from beyond the confines of unknown space, ending with the First Order staging an invasion of the galaxy, but were repelled by the Resistance and Jedi Order, causing First Order rule to crumble.

        The seeds of the First Order were planted before the Galactic Empire rose to power, as part of a posthumous contingency to ensured the Empire did not outlive its Galactic Emperor in the event of Darth Sidious death and to rebuild it within the Unknown Regions, culminating in the First Order, that was to be subservient to an unseen force controlled by the revived Darth Sidious, with the mysterious Snoke being an artificial genetic construct to rule it as Supreme Leader around 24 ABY, who supplanted the former leadership. Much of the First Order however, was unaware of this itself nor their ultimate purpose in it and was further unaware of Snoke's true origins.

        Some systems left the New Republic and aligned with the First Order in 29 ABY, precipitating it public formation to the galaxy. Consequently, the Cold War began with the New Republic, a state of tensions in which there was occasional skirmishes and incidents. In violation of the regulations of the Galactic Concordance, the First Order initiated a vast rearmament program by building military installations, shipyards, weapons research facilities, developed technologically superior military and a mysterious project. It also began to use child conscripts—thousands of whom were abducted from outlying systems—into a new generation of stormtroopers. Due to this hostility, former Senator Leia Organa founded the Resistance to monitor the activities of the Order due to the Senate being unwilling to take external threats seriously. Despite increasing First Order aggression, the New Republic refused to take forceful military action against them, for they believed that they posed no real, credible threat to the galaxy at large.

        Five years later, full scale open warfare began after the First Order conducted a preemptive strike on Hosnian Prime, then-capital of the New Republic before commencing a massive invasion. Though its superweapon was destroyed by the Resistance, its armies and fleets vastly outnumbered the Resistance. Snoke was assassinated by the warlord, Kylo Ren, who after this coup, declared himself as Supreme Leader. However, Ren rule was met with defiance and rebellion. A year later, a mysterious transmission by the reborn Darth Sidious. Determined to prevent any threats to his rule, Ren diverted resources away from the ongoing war and found the source at hidden world of Exegol. There, he discovered Sidious, who offered his fleet and his intended Sith Empire to Ren. However, Ren renounced the dark side, returning to the light as Ben Solo. The First Order was then assumed by Allegiant General Enric Pryde, who swore allegiance to Sidious. However, the Emperor's plans were undone by the Resistance; reinforced by a allied fleet, which ended Sidious and prevented a return of a dark age of a thousand years past.

        Without the support of the fleet to reinforce them, an uprising against the rule of First Order erupted on many worlds across the galaxy, causing the First Order's hold to fade as people gathered the will to rise up and the Jedi Order ushering in a new sense of hope and a possible return of the New Republic in some form. The First Order would soon fall, and was ultimately defeated.</text>
